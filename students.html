  When you receive a job offer the company has already determined the length of the program, it can span between 3-12 weeks but the details will be provided to you with the position offer. Knowing how inconsistent uni schedules are we give you the flexibility to select the number of days you'd like to work. We request that you allow at least two days a week. We are here to help you through the process if you need any help.
