  We all know work experience is important, it's one of the top things employers look at when hiring. The problem is finding quality work that you can
  do while at uni is not easy. We understand that for some, the positions aren't quality experiences, and for others, they might not be able to give
  up a shift or two of your part-time job to make time. We're here to help, we'll match you with jobs that you're best suited for. They'll provide
  quality paid (emphasis on paid because we know what your time is worth) work experience which you can add to your CV and who knows, you may
  potentially get job offers when you complete them.

      To get started fill out the application form with your personal details, studies, work history, skills, and hobbies. We then get to know you

      Once you've completed your application, we review it and try to get back to you quickly. We know how frustrating it is when you get a copy paste
      rejection email but if you don't make it through we will provide you with feedback on what to work on, and you can reapply after six months.

      Yay! You've successfully made it through our vetting process, and you've been placed in our 'talent pool'. As we add you in we create a profile on your behalf based on your application, and it sits here waiting for a job that is a top match for you.

      When we receive a position we think is a good match for your profile, we'll notify you of the offer and its details. Although it's short notice you have 48 hours to agree as to whether you'd like to be included in the selection process. If you accept, your profile is one of the few provided to the company for them to choose from. If you miss the deadline we can't hand over your profile and sadly you'd get left out of the process.

      Depending on the company's preference they may ask to have a final interview with you, which we will help facilitate and guide you through.

  When you receive a job offer the company has already determined the length of the program, it can span between 3-12 weeks but the details will be provided to you with the position offer. Knowing how inconsistent uni schedules are we give you the flexibility to select the number of days you'd like to work. We request that you allow at least two days a week. We are here to help you through the process if you need any help.
