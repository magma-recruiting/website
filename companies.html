  One of the most cost-effective ways to add enthusiastic, engaged and diverse resources to your business is through hiring students. We match you with
  pre-vetted, top students who are passionate, self-starters and who want to apply their studies and grow in your company. We offer you the flexibility
  to "try before you buy" and get a step-up on your important projects. Why wait for students to become 'graduates' to recruit them, beat your
  competitors to the punch and get access whilst they're studying.

      We provide you with the profiles of the top 3-5 students that best match your position. From there, we can facilitate any further recruitment
      processes so that you can make the best choice for your company.

      Once you've chosen the applicant(s) you want, you can trial them for your specified duration with no ongoing commitment; however, it must be paid
      work. This is a must if you want to attract the best students.

      Once the work experience has completed, and if you're highly satisfied with the match, you may also offer them a job for after they graduate,
      however it is not a requirement. If the student accepts your job offer, you will need to pay our offloading fee.

  We allow you the flexibility to choose the length of the program, we recommend between 3-12 weeks. The number of days however, are dependent on the
  students' availability, we require them to be able to do no less than 2 days a week. We are here to help you through the process whenever you need.
