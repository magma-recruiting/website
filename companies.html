  We match you with vetted, top-quality students to "try before you buy" and test them in your company. There is no obligation to keep them on permanently, but we're confident you'll want to offer them a full time position.

  Why wait for students to become 'graduates' to recruit them?

        We offer two options for employment. You can pay upfront, or you can "try before you buy" and pay an offloading fee when
        you decide to take them on permanently. In the latter option, a fee is placed on top of the student's wage during placement.
